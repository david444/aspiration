## Dev notes

* This project project was created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
* Use Apollo to get data from GraphQL
## How to run
### `npm start` 

Runs the project, there is no testing script to run. I'm still learning the testing side of react. 


## Future Improvements
Feel free to elaborate on how you would improve any of the following topics
* Code Structuring: Because I haven't worked on a large react project, from all the tutorials that I've made I think this is the one that I liked the most, I looks like it scale well on large applicatiions.
* Refactoring: Not sure if the table is the best approach to handle the data, but I think it works well for this example. 
    * Add the tests.
* Additional Features: Adding a text box to type the topic.
